== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if my favorite social bookmark service is not yet included? =

Let me know and I will try to add your prefered service to the plugin!

= What if I don't see the icons and only see the alt tags? =

Check if your directory name for the plugin matches hb-social-bookmark-widget exactly. In other cases you have to adjust the directory name in the hb-social-bookmarks.php, but then your plugin is not auto update compatible anymore.
